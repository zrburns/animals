        <span>
          Rattlensnakes can be found in most fields far away from roads or populated areas, although they have been known to be seen in those as well. While they are poisonous snakes, there is known medical treatment for their bite, however it will hurt immensely. Rattlensakes can be identified by the diamond shading of their scales and the bulbous "rattle" found at the tip of their tail. While they are generally thought of as vicious animals, snakes tend to only react to intruders rather than attack larger creatures. It is once their territory is invaded that the titular rattle comes into play, as they will make noise to scare away the intruder just as poisonous dart frogs colors are meant to alert potential predators of their poisonous nature.
