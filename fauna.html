        <h3>Rattlesnake</h3>
        <span>
          Rattlensnakes can be found in most fields far away from roads or populated areas, although they have been known to be seen in those as well. While they are poisonous snakes, there is known medical treatment for their bite, however it will hurt immensely. Rattlensakes can be identified by the diamond shading of their scales and the bulbous "rattle" found at the tip of their tail. While they are generally thought of as vicious animals, snakes tend to only react to intruders rather than attack larger creatures. It is once their territory is invaded that the titular rattle comes into play, as they will make noise to scare away the intruder just as poisonous dart frogs colors are meant to alert potential predators of their poisonous nature.

        <h3 >Black Widow</h3>
        <span>
          The black widow is another poisonous animal, although due to the size and nature of the species they are far more ubiquitous than than the rattle snake. On first sight a black widow will look like any other spider, however on closer inspection they are actually quite easy to identify. If the spider is large enough, you will be able to see the bright red hourglass shape on the abdomen of the spider, as seen to the right. However, even if the spider is not large enough to see this identifier, with a little experience you will find them easily identifiable due to their dark black color and large abdomen. The abdomen is exceedingly large, quite larger in proportion to their body and larger than other spiders of a similar size.

        <h3>Coyote</h3>
        <span>
          Coyotes, like the aforementioned black widow and rattlesnake is an animal that is only dangerous when cornered or feel that it itself is in danger. They can frequently be seen in various fields surrounding town, particularly in areas which have chicken coops or other small animals which serve as easy prey for a predator of their relatively small stature.
