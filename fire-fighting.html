      <p>Sometimes it is difficult to look at an organization and imagine it as anything other than what it is today. It is sometimes unsettling to acknowledge that things are not constant; that what we think we know today, what we are so sure of this very moment, may be different tomorrow. Yet it is the ability to change that makes CAL FIRE such an outstanding organization. It is change that brings new faces and experiences into our structure. And, it is change that keeps us flexible and able to adapt as the decades pass.
      </p>
      <p>
      In 2005 CAL FIRE celebrated 100 years of history. Throughout those years the Department experienced tremendous change. We invite you to explore CAL FIREs history on this site. From the Air Program and Mobile Equipment, to the Conservation Camp Program and Resource Management, it has been a long and ever evolving history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many lives and events have shaped the history of CAL FIRE since 1905. We will continue to share that history with you on this site.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men and women of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) are dedicated to the fire protection and stewardship of over 31 million acres of California's privately-owned wildlands. In addition, the Department provides varied emergency services in 36 of the State's 58 counties via contracts with local governments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Department's firefighters, fire engines, and aircraft respond to an average of more than 5,600 wildland fires each year. Those fires burn more than 172,000 acres annually.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Californians are learning more and more about the good as well as the bad of fire, the prevention of large, damaging fires remains a priority for CAL FIRE. From Smokey Bear, to the thousands of CAL FIRE Volunteers in Prevention (VIPs), to new alliances with communities, private industry, and government agencies, aggressive action in fire prevention and fire safety is occurring throughout the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond its wildland fire fighting role, CAL FIRE answers the call more than 350,000 times for other emergencies each year. It may very well be a CAL FIRE engine and crew that is dispatched to the scene of an auto accident, or to a home where a child has become the victim of a drowning incident. The Department is always ready to respond - medical aids; hazardous material spills; swiftwater rescues; search and rescue missions; civil disturbances; train wrecks; floods, earthquakes and more.
