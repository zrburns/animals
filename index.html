  The history of Californiaâ€™s Central Valley goes back millions of years to the moment when the earth cracked, pressing mountains of granite to create the mountains that form the valley walls. The Central Valley stretches 450 miles, and is separated from the ocean to the West by the Pacific Coast Range. The remaining borders are the Cascade Mountains to the north, the Tehachapi Mountains to the South, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the East. The Central valley consists of the lowland region that falls between these mountains, and consists of two smaller valleys: the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Valley.

  <div>The Central Valley has a wide variety of flora and fauna, some of which are iconic and emblematic of both the countryside and the West. The animals within this site can be seen frequently in the fields surrounding the local towns, but due to the nature of the area can also frequently be seen within the city limits as well. The Mediterranean climate has proved sufficient to sustain the areas position as a center of agricultural commerce.

    California fish and game is a government division which regulates and tracks the animals with which we as humans cohabitate. They are brave men and women who spend the majority of their time in nature tracking both crimes against animals and crimes committed by animals. This is not their website. This website is created with semi-accurate information accumulated through brief and not-very-thorough google sessions, the information gathered from this research was then vetted by comparing it to completely anecdotal evidence and knowledge held by a test-group of one, the most accurate statistical group.
