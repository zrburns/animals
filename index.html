  The history of Californiaâ€™s Central Valley goes back millions of years to the moment when the earth cracked, pressing mountains of granite to create the mountains that form the valley walls. The Central Valley stretches 450 miles, and is separated from the ocean to the West by the Pacific Coast Range. The remaining borders are the Cascade Mountains to the north, the Tehachapi Mountains to the South, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the East. The Central valley consists of the lowland region that falls between these mountains, and consists of two smaller valleys: the Sacramento and he San Joaquin Valley.
  </p>
    <br>
  <p>The Central Valley has a wide variety of flora and fauna, some of which are iconic and emblematic of both the countryside and the West. The animals within this site can be seen frequently in the fields surrounding the local towns, but due to the nature of the area can also frequently be seen within the city limits as well. The Mediterranean climate has proved sufficient to sustain the areas position as a center of agricultural commerce.
